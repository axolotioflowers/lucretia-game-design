                <p> Hi, my name is Lucretia Greville(24408581) and I am a student going to UL. This blog is meant to act as my dev 
                diary for my group's project as part of our CS4043 game design module. The project so far is a 2D roguelike turn based 
                game that takes place in the ocean, I nominated myself as the as the sound designer as well as composer along
                with Mykhailo who will also be composing the music. I'm somewhat familiar with GarageBand on IOS so I will likely end up using 
                that for the some of game's music and sound effects. Below are a few demo tracks I made to try and capture the feeling 
                the game is going for, to try and sound sombre, depressing and also fit the sci-fi marine setting. They're really 
                experimental as I'm still learning how to use GarageBand and nowhere good enough to be in the game but making them
                has been great experience. The first demo may be used for the titlescreen, it has the feel of an old gameboy game 
                starting music to me.<p>

                </audio>
                <p>The second demo is meant to be much more oppressive sounding than the first and may be used in a scene where we enter the 
                final zone of the game.</p>
