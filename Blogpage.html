                <p> Hi, my name is Lucretia Greville(24408581) and I am a student going to UL. This blog is meant to act as my dev 
                diary for "Fortnite 2" a group project for our game design module. "Fortnite 2" is a 2D roguelike turn based 
                game that takes place in the ocean, I nominated myself as the as the sound designer as well as composer along
                with Mykhailo  who will also be composing the music. I'm familiar with GarageBand so I will likely end up using 
                that for the some of game's music and sound effects.<p>
